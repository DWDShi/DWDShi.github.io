    <p>This is the landing page for my personal website, where I can showcase my many projects which include:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Java simulations of traffic using multithreading, used to tune the timing of traffic lights at
            junctions.</li>
        <li>An augmented reality application which would overlay arrows onto the ground, helping people unfamiliar with
            the area navigate around.</li>
        <li>Many examples of machine learning solutions, across a wide array of disciplines.</li>

    </ul>

    <p> And many more, which can be found below!</p>
